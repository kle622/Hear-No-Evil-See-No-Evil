----- Controls -----
Use 'WASD' to move the player. Use the mouse to control the camera. Sprint by
holding down 'shift', and toggle crouch by pressing 'control'. When sprinting,
certain game objects in the world can be pushed. Crouching makes it harder for
guards to see you behind low barriers. 

----- Debug Modes -----

Press 'space' to toggle the free-floating debug camera. While in debug camera
mode, press 'o' to decrease camera movement speed, and press 'p' to increase it.
The 'j' and 'k' keys can be used to move the camera vertically down and up,
respectively.

Press 'b' to toggle debug geometry drawing in normal camera mode. Geometry
drawing will always be present in debug camera mode.
